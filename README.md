**Note:** 
- The `↪︎` symbol implies that the browser uses the same engine captured by the name.
- Opera Mobile is approximately equivalent to Chrome Android.
- All iOS browsers use WebKit.
- Opera Mini has two modes: “Extreme” and “High” for data saving. `op_mini` targets the “Extreme” mode, while “High” is compatible with the normal Opera Mobile.
